            <h1>Admin Panel, 'Garden'</h1>
            <p>'The Garden' is an in-house admin-panel built from scratch and is still actively improving.</p>
            <p>It controls all the contents on our front-end website, process orders, CRMs, and other departments' features, including marketing and finance teams.</p>
            <p>In 2021, around 300 people from Trenbe and partners use our platform to process about 2000 orders daily.</p>
            <h3>My Role</h3>
            <p>I played a dual role as both the product owner and the UX designer and worked with two other developers from concepts to launch. I was responsible for creating and handing over designs and product ownership, making Trenbers' job easier and getting more things done.</p>
            <p>I conducted stakeholder interviews, research and helping people to use new features from day one.</p>
